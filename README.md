# Innovative_system_project_3

This is an end to end implementation of a web application that can detect human emotions such as Anger, Happiness, Surprise, Sadness etc based on the image input given to it.
For sucessfully predicting the emotion I tried training deep learning model using CNNS, transfer learning models likes VGG-16 AND VGG-19 and custom built Resnets. 
For the purpose of developing the web application I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 
Flask was used to integrate the model with the front-end. The complete application is then deployed using Heroku.

Applications of such a system are vast. Some of the use cases are listed below:
1. Video gaming
2. Medical diagnosis - Software can help doctors with the diagnosis of diseases such as depression and dementia.
3. Education. Learning software prototypes have been developed to adapt to kids’ emotions. 
4. Patient care- A ‘nurse bot’ not only reminds older patients on long-term medical programs to take their medication, but also converses with them every day to monitor the their overall wellbeing.
5. Car safety 
6. Fraud detection
7. Recruiting. Software is used during job interviews to understand the credibility of a candidate.
8. Call center intelligent routing. An angry customer can be detected from the beginning and can be routed to a well-trained agent who can also monitor in real-time how the conversation is going and adjust.
